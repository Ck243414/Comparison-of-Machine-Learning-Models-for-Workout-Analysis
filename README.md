# Comparison-of-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Workout-Analysis
This the Machine Learning project that i worked on ,in which i made a custom ML model based on Ensemble Technique along with Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResCNN) to outperform the target research paper on the same dataset which was used in the original paper.
